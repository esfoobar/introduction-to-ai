## Introduction to LLMs (15 minutes)

### Core Concepts

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - AI systems trained on massive text datasets
  - Trillions of adjustable parameters
  - Pattern recognition through repeated exposure
  - Knowledge synthesis and generation
- Scale and Complexity
  - Simple calculator: ~100 parameters
  - Face recognition: ~millions of parameters
  - GPT-4: >1 trillion parameters
- Training Process
  - Parameters are the controlling knobs of the model
  - Like tuning millions of interconnected instruments in an orchestra
  - Pattern recognition and optimization
  - Once trained, the model can't learn new things

> What are LLMs?

### Text Processing

- Tokenization System
  - Breaking text into processable pieces
  - Like Lego blocks of language
  - Enables handling of new words
- Common Word Processing
  - Frequent words as single tokens
  - Complex words split into pieces
  - Example: "uncomfortable" â†’ "un" "comfort" "able"
- Special Cases
  - Emoji processing: ðŸ™‚ as single token
  - Numbers and symbols: "hello123" â†’ "hello" "123"
  - Offers Multilingual support and Unicode handling

> SPEAKER NOTES (3 minutes):

> The fundamental building blocks of LLMs are tokens

### The Context Window
- Context Window
  - The amount of text the model can "see" at once
  - Determines the scope of understanding and provides guidance
  - Allows the model to understand the progression of a conversation

> SPEAKER NOTES (4 minutes):

> What is the context?

### Challenges and Limitations
