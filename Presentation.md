## Introduction to LLMs and what AI is in general

---

### Core Concepts

- AI systems trained on text data
- Learn language patterns
- Millions of adjustable parameters
- Generate human-like responses

> SPEAKER NOTES (3 minutes):
>
> Opening Hook:
> "Imagine having a conversation with someone who has read every book ever written. That's similar to what LLMs can do."
>
> Simple Parameters Explanation:
> "Think of parameters like knobs on a massive mixing board in a recording studio:
> - Each knob controls something specific (like bass, treble, volume)
> - When making music, you adjust these knobs to get the right sound
> - In LLMs, billions of these 'knobs' are automatically adjusted during training
> - After training, these knobs stay fixed, like a perfectly tuned instrument"
>
> Scale Examples:
> - A simple calculator: ~100 parameters
> - Face recognition: ~millions of parameters
> - GPT-4: >1 trillion parameters
>
> Teaching Resources:
> - Original GPT paper: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf
> - Anthropic's LLM Guide: https://www.anthropic.com/index/understanding-llms

---

### Text to Tokens

- Words split into smaller pieces
- "uncomfortable" → "un" "comfort" "able"
- Numbers and symbols also split
- Helps handle new words

> SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):
>
> Simple Explanation:
> "Think of tokenization like breaking down words into Lego pieces. Just as you can build many things with a limited set of Lego blocks, LLMs can understand many words using a limited set of tokens."
>
> Fun Examples to Share:
> - "skateboarding" → "skate" "board" "ing"
> - "🙂" → [single token]
> - "hello123" → "hello" "123"
>
> Key Points:
> - Most common words are single tokens
> - Rare words split into common pieces
> - Model has fixed vocabulary (usually 50K-100K tokens)
> - Enables handling of never-before-seen words

---

### Learning Process

- Like tuning a musical instrument
- Each parameter is a tiny adjustment
- Training finds the right settings
- Settings become fixed after training

> SPEAKER NOTES (3 minutes):
>
> Musical Instrument Analogy:
> "Imagine tuning every string on a thousand pianos at once:
> - Each string is like a parameter
> - Training is like automatically tuning all strings
> - The goal is perfect harmony
> - Once tuned, the settings stay fixed"
>
> Real-world Examples:
> - Basic calculator: ~100 adjustments needed
> - Smartphone camera: ~thousands of adjustments
> - Modern LLM: ~billions of adjustments
>
> Why So Many Parameters?
> - Language is incredibly complex
> - Need to capture many patterns
> - More parameters = more nuanced understanding
> - Like having more strings for more complex music

---

### Key Capabilities

### Current Challenges

- Hallucinations
- Context window limits
- Bias in responses
- High resource usage

> SPEAKER NOTES (3 minutes):
>
> Hallucinations Explained:
> "Think of hallucinations like a student confidently making up answers in an exam:
> - Sometimes invents fake facts
> - Mixes up different pieces of information
> - Can sound very convincing while being wrong
> - Example: Creating fake research papers or citations"
>
> Context Window Analogy:
> "Imagine trying to read a book through a small window that only shows a few pages at a time:
> - Can only 'see' limited amount of text (2K-32K tokens)
> - May miss important information from earlier pages
> - Struggles with very long documents
> - Can lose track of context in long conversations"
>
> Real Examples to Share:
> - GPT-3 inventing a fake scientific paper
> - Claude mixing up historical dates
> - GitHub Copilot suggesting plausible but incorrect code
> - Chatbots forgetting earlier parts of conversation

---

### More Challenges

- Repetitive outputs
- Can't verify facts
- No true understanding
- Limited reasoning

> SPEAKER NOTES (3 minutes):
>
> Repetition Issues:
> "Like a person who keeps falling back on their favorite phrases:
> - Can get stuck in patterns
> - May repeat similar answers
> - Sometimes uses formulaic responses"
>
> Fact Verification:
> "Similar to someone who has read many books but can't double-check them:
> - No ability to search the internet
> - Can't verify current information
> - Mixes real and misremembered facts
> - Training data cutoff limits knowledge"
>
> Understanding Limitations:
> "Like a very advanced pattern-matching system:
> - No real world experience
> - Can't learn from conversations
> - No true common sense
> - Struggles with cause and effect"
>
> Latest Research on Solutions:
> - Constitutional AI for better truthfulness
> - Retrieval-augmented generation for fact-checking
> - Chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning

> - Needs careful prompt engineering"
>
> Environmental Impact:
> - Training a large model = emissions from 300 houses for a year
> - Continuous operation requires significant energy
> - Growing resource requirements
>
> Privacy Considerations:

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

---

### Core Principles

- Be specific and clear
- Provide context
- Use examples
- Structure matters

> SPEAKER NOTES (4 minutes):

> "Prompt engineering is like learning to communicate with a brilliant but very literal foreign exchange student - the more precise and structured you are, the better the results."
>
> Key Principles Breakdown:
> 1. Specificity:
>    - Instead of "Write a blog post", use "Write a 500-word blog post about AI safety for tech executives"
>    - Include format, length, tone, audience
>    - Specify output structure when needed
>
> 2. Context:
>    - Provide relevant background information
>    - Define role and perspective
>    - Set clear constraints and requirements
>
> Teaching Resources:
> - Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Guide: https://www.anthropic.com/prompt-engineering
> - OpenAI Cookbook: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook

> Bad Output: "Looking at the numbers..."
> Good Output: "Q1 revenue increased 23%..."
>
> Input: "Analyze this quarterly update"
> Your turn: [Let model complete]
> ```
>
> Chain of Thought Demo:
> "Let's solve this step by step:
> 1. First, identify key metrics
> 2. Then, compare against benchmarks
> 3. Finally, draw conclusions"
>
> System Prompts:
> - Set the personality/role
> - Define constraints
> - Establish output format
